# Captains Log
Creator: [Jacob C. Ochoa](https://github.com/OchoNet)

Captains Log is a Windows application that manages your daily to-do list, Logs time spent on each, and stores the Log in a local folder (Desktop\Captains_Log).
Tasks can be tagged to specific accounts and marked as complete or incomplete. Logs are saved as CSV files, and Summaries can be generated by week or by account.

## Recent Improvements

Captains Log has been enhanced for better robustness and user experience:

- **Safer File Handling** ‚Äì File read/write operations are reliable, with improved exception handling and auto-recovery for locked or missing files.
- **Error Prevention** ‚Äì Input sanitization prevents invalid time entries or malformed Task lines from being Logged.
- **Autosave Protection** ‚Äì The app now checks for write permissions and folder existence before attempting to save Logs.
- **Calendar Sync Stability** ‚Äì Improved Logic ensures that calendar updates don't break if Logs are missing or corrupted.
- **More Responsive UI** ‚Äì Background thread improvements ensure the UI remains responsive during file or Summary generation.

## Features

- Add Tasks with optional account tags (e.g. `#DEV`) and time estimates (e.g. `@1.5`)
- View daily Logs using a calendar interface
- Mark Tasks as complete or incomplete
- Edit Task time entries
- Enable selection mode to delete or update multiple Tasks at once
- Automatically saves Logs to disk in CSV format
- Generate weekly Summaries or monthly account-based Summaries as `.txt` files

## How to Use

1. üìù Add one Task per line in the text box. Optionally include:
   - `#ACCOUNT` to tag a Task to an account (defaults to `MISC`)
   - `@HOURS` to record how much time was spent  
   **Example Tasks:**
   - `ix Login bug #DEV @1.5`
   - `Deploy release v2.3 #OPS @2`
   - `Team sync meeting @1`

2. ‚ûï Click "Add Tasks" to Log them for the currently selected day.

3. üìÖ Use the calendar to view Logs from different dates. **Days with Logs are highlighted.**

4. üñ±Ô∏è Right-click on any Task to mark it complete, incomplete, or delete it.
